SageMath Inc. 2015 SBIR proposal

This is a proposal to the NSF from the company SageMath Inc 
asking for money to support work on an interactive homework
problem system to be built on top of SageMathCloud during 
January-June of 2016.

Look at description.md or description.md.pdf, which is the
only part that is written at present.
