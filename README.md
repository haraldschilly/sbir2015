SageMath Inc. 2015 SBIR proposal

https://github.com/sagemathinc/sbir2015

This is a proposal to the NSF from the company SageMath Inc
asking for money to support work on an interactive homework
problem system to be built on top of SageMathCloud during
January-June of 2016.  I plan to submit it **Sunday, June 14, 2015.**

NOTE: The project description has a very mandated structure as explained at http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2015/nsf15546/nsf15546.htm; also the proposal itself must be for an entirely new thing -- if it were just "iterative ways to make SageMathCloud better", it would
be instantly rejected without review.
