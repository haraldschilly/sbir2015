and will direct the project and do a large amount of engineering
work on it. He will receive a salary of \$6667/month.

# B. Other Personnel

- *Other Professionals (Technicians, etc.):* The company plans to hire
(at \$45/hour) one part-time non-student to work on this project,
possibly a Sage developer who wants to take time off from teaching
to develop software.

- *Graduate Students:* The company plans to hire 2 graduate students
at an hourly rate of \$25/hour to help implement
the software.  There are numerous experienced senior
Sage developer graduate students at University of Washington,
including Andrew Ohana, Travis Scholl, and Hao Chen, who are
all interested in working on the project.  We estimate these employees
will work an average of 20 hours per week.

at an hourly rate of \$25/hour to help implement the software.
There are several undergraduates, including Jon Lee and Nicholas Ruhland

We estimate these employees will work an average of 15 hours per week.
