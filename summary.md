# Project Summary

(NOT STARTED)

> "The Project Summary should be written in the third person, [...]  understandable to a scientifically or technically literate lay reader. It should not be an abstract of the proposal."  4,600 character limit, including spaces.

We aim to transform over a decade of NSF-funded mathematical software
development into a cloud-based platform for mathematics that
has broad social and economic benefit.

This project would transform science and engineering research and education, and lead to major commercial and public benefits if successful.

## Box 1: Overview, Key Words, and Subtopic Name
- Describe the potential outcome(s) of the proposed activity in terms of a product, process, or service.
- Provide a list of key words or phrases that identify the areas of technical expertise to be invoked in reviewing the proposal; and the areas of application that are the initial target of the technology.
- Provide the subtopic name.

## Box 2: Intellectual Merit
> Must start this way:

This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project ...

> "Briefly describe the technical hurdle(s) that will addressed by the proposed R&D (which should be crucial to successful commercialization of the innovation), the goals of the proposed R&D, and a high-level summary of the plan to reach those goals."

- Create a homework system that uniquely addresses needs at the advanced mathematics level.
   - (RAB) homework system
     - beyond algebra, calculus, intro linear algebra
     - does WW do any differential equations???
     - can I design a good group theory question with an "answer checker" that requires Sage permutation groups


- Make SMC 10x more efficient.


- Make excess cloud compute resources from Amazon and Google much more accessible to students and STEM researchers by ...

## Box 3: Broader/Commercial Impact

> "In the short term, the proposed R&D activity is expected to bring the innovation closer to commercialization under a sustainable business model. In this box, describe the potential impacts on society that would be created by the commercialization of the innovation. Examples include generating larger economic impacts, meeting societal needs, and enabling further scientific / technological understanding."

- Meet a gaping need in math-related education, especially at the advanced level in STEM, which will raise technological capabilities of people.

- Improve scientific research infrastructure by making much better use of cloud compute facilities.

- Collatoral impact due to freemium business model, e.g., on young kids without money, on people in third world countries (site some SMC stats right now).
