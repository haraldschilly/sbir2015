# Budget Justification


Ask for \$150K/month over 6 months, which is \$25K/month.

Budget:

- 1.5 FTE.......\$17K/month
- Consultant....\$ 3K/month
- Students......\$ 5K/month



---

What:

- hire William Stein 51% time to work on this - \$7K/month
- pay Beezer part time as a consultant - \$3K/month
- (RAB) Beezer \$3K/mo sounds good.  Have to ask Deans.  I think I need to be consultant, since UPS won't want me to be an employee, SBIR would want me to be half-time?
- hire 3 UW students - \$5K/month
- one fulltime person to write software - \$10K/month
- hire an experienced business person to consult ... - \$3K/month
   - (RAB) Business expertise on the team
   - "Advise on business/market implications of design decisions on efficiency/pricing"
   - I think this would be very good to have, so long as it does not impinge on banned activities


    25*2/3 = 50/3 is about 17, which matches above.


- a workshop combining top SMC devs and users??
  - (RAB) Excellent idea
- overhead

Actual rule says:
> "The employment of faculty as senior personnel and of graduate or undergraduate students as assistants by the small business may also occur, in which case the researchers (faculty and/or students) would be listed on the proposing company's budget Line A, B.2, or B.6, as appropriate, instead of on a subaward / sub-budget. However, note that for an SBIR Phase I Proposal, a minimum of two-thirds of the research, as measured by the budget, must be performed by the small business concern, and the balance may be outsourced to consultants or subcontractors or a combination thereof."
